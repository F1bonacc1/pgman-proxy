## pgmctl promote

Not supported: use switchover or failover

### Synopsis

pgmctl promote is not supported. It called POST /v1/promote, which
reported success but never promoted anything: pg-manager records the
request and does not act on it.

Instead, with a cluster leader:

    pgmctl switchover --target NODE   # move the primary to a chosen peer
    pgmctl failover                   # let the cluster pick its best standby

```
pgmctl promote [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for promote
```
